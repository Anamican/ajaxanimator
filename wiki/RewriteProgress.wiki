As of 7/01/08 the new version is reasonably stable, there are only a few main  areas of improvent.

  * server code, unsure, GAE?
  * exporting - complex, unsure
  * clipboard - need to examine onlypaths' implementation 
  * keyboard shortcuts - easy, procrastinating
  * documentation (help, Faq,manual, tutorials, etc.) - boring
  * stability - tedious, lazy
  * library - unsure
  * user-related community/social aspect, unsure
  * idk
