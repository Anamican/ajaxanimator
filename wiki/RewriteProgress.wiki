#summary the under-updated details of the future release

= Introduction =

As you may know from the previous article, I'm rewriting the ajaxanimator.

As of 7/01/08 the new version is reasonably stable, there are only a few main  areas of improvent.

  * server code, unsure, GAE?
  * exporting - complex, unsure
  * clipboard - need to examine onlypaths' implementation 
  * keyboard shortcuts - easy, procrastinating
  * documentation (help, Faq,manual, tutorials, etc.) - boring
  * stability - tedious, lazy
  * library - unsure
  * user-related community/social aspect, unsure
  * history (undo/redo) - unsure

Quite possibly more, but this is all that ce to my head. It is largely more usable than 0.14.7 already, but some features are not here yet.

PATH elements are complex and I'm debating whetheror not to put it as a
goal

IE support is hard, nearly impossible, despite extreme advancement since previously
the vmlrenderer is flawed and incomplete. It really feels pointless to work n a dead platfom (vml) and spend time knowing it'll only run on a single crappy browser.

Speed is really an issue. It caused a 200mb memeak on Fx3. Yes.... 3. Can u imagine it on IE?
